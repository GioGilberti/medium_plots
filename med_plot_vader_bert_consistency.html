*not* work, links in emailed notifications fail with the mobile app, and a platform designed for reading does *not* allow me to choose a preferred font. the sun is setting on medium: go to substack.","the app itself is great and there's a fair amount of good content, but unless you're willing to pay for the subscription it's not with it. way too many subscriber-only stories.","i just

authors, and weed out the weaker ones. \n\nin terms of issues, well, i\u2019ll put them here because i can no longer find the way to submit feedback in the app. i\u2019ve had challenges managing my subscription, vis-\u00e0-vis app store vs website. and i\u2019m always annoyed by the in-story \u2018clap\u2019 and comment buttons; i nearly always miss and wind up on the author\u2019s article page. these buttons are really poorly designed and prevent me from engaging as much as i\u2019d like. another thing that i\u2019d like to see improved is the voice on the read-aloud feature. it\u2019s too robotic and rather unpleasant. the highlight feature, which is used for\u2026something\u2026 is hard to deselect and it\u2019s purpose is as not intuitive as i think they believe.\n\nthat said, medium is a key source of writing for me and i strongly recommend it for people that want to enjoy a torrent of solid articles, without ads, to engage with every day.","simply wonderful!","this platform is a

that medium has evolved their monetization strategy and i simply hope that the company considers small, \u201cpart-time\u201d writers like me when setting policy.  \n\nmedium grew as a vibrant, open writers community,  and it has inspired me to improve my writing and to hone my ideas and stories.","nice information to make sure can't miss this opportunity guys.","this is the only app i pay, for i

indicate that the authors are *objectively* experts at their subjects.   when you go to a doctor\u2019s office, you see degrees from medical schools and certifications from licensing agencies to legitimize their diagnoses and opinions. what i have read on medium would suggest that the authors are writing from their own experiences, colored by their own preconceptions, and that they are projecting their conclusions from limited and biased sample sizes onto the greater population at large. there\u2019s nothing scientific to give these biased opinions any credibility. facebook and youtube operate by recommending posts that conform to previous activity, reinforcing previously held stereotypes and fostering confirmation bias. medium does the same thing, just using the written word rather than videos or posted links. i hope that medium will update its advertising to be more accurate. it is in no way an encyclopedia of expertise. self-appointed \u201cexperts\u201d have no

found it, instead of a sign of relief, i got even more annoyed. who puts followers behind a plus icon?? plus indicates adding more, like maybe drafting a new post or adding a new topic to follow.

effectively filter down to the good articles. \n\nthe content needs to be curated. there is an option for each article that says \u201cshow less like this\u201d, but no indication of how \u201clike this\u201d is quantified. my fear is that if i click the option on a programming article that is completely incorrect, i will get fewer programming articles rather than fewer incorrect articles. when liking or disliking an article, the user needs to be able to indicate what they liked or disliked about it. \n\nat the moment, about 1 in 5 articles live up to the title of their post. that makes this

the technology related articles. i am old school and technology isn\u2019t one of my main interests yet i know i must try to keep up or be out of a job. normally i find it boring to read about, but the articles i subscribe to on medium are interesting because they are down-to-earth and not full of jargon i don\u2019t understand. \nit also does not seem to lean either way politically for the most part and i like that for a change. for every article i do feel has a political connotation one way, i can find another written from a dissenting view to equal the scales.\nthanks, medium, for

the article and chose \u201cedit\u201d mode. trouble is, the functionality to edit is very limited. for example, i selected an icon to see what it does and it added a python text box to my article. now i can\u2019t get rid of it! it should not be so difficult to figure out how to add or subtract something from the article. and where is the back button??  lousy ui/ui design! a simple editor is a good idea. i get that. but so basic that you don\u2019t have a back button or a delete function to remove unintentionally added features? if you do have them, i am confused as to where they are.

fantastic job of curating articles based on my interests, ensuring that i always have something engaging to read.\n\nthe quality of the articles on medium is consistently high. many of the writers are experts in their fields, and their knowledge and insights shine through in their writing. i appreciate the fact that medium allows both professional journalists and everyday individuals to share their

for me as a writer and researcher. i can easily save and refer back to important passages, making it a valuable tool for learning and reference.\n\nfurthermore, medium's community aspect is a standout feature. the commenting system allows for meaningful discussions and interactions with other readers and writers. i have found the community to be supportive, engaging, and respectful, fostering a positive environment for sharing ideas and feedback.\n\noverall, i highly recommend medium for anyone who enjoys reading and writing thought-provoking articles. it offers a fantastic platform for

page. these buttons are really poo&lt;br&gt;rly designed and prevent me from engaging as much as i\u2019d lik&lt;br&gt;e. another thing that i\u2019d like to see improved is the voice &lt;br&gt;on the read-aloud feature. it\u2019s too robotic and rather unple&lt;br&gt;asant. the highlight feature, which is used for\u2026something\u2026 i&lt;br&gt;s hard to deselect and it\u2019s purpose is as not intuitive as i&lt;br&gt; think they believe.\n\nthat said, medium is a key source of w&lt;br&gt;riting for me and i strongly recommend it for people that wa&lt;br&gt;nt to enjoy a torrent of solid articles, without ads, to eng&lt;br&gt;age with every day.","simply wonderful!","this platform is a reservoir of knowledge and network with t&lt;br&gt;he right people.","perfect","great quick reads in

also enjoyed the wor&lt;br&gt;k of other writers on medium and the comments and collaborat&lt;br&gt;ion with other writers or readers.\n\ni know that medium has e&lt;br&gt;volved their monetization strategy and i simply hope that th&lt;br&gt;e company considers small, \u201cpart-time\u201d writers like me when &lt;br&gt;setting policy.  \n\nmedium grew as a vibrant, open writers

would like to make. so, i selected the article and chose \u201ce&lt;br&gt;dit\u201d mode. trouble is, the functionality to edit is very lim&lt;br&gt;ited. for example, i selected an icon to see what it does an&lt;br&gt;d it added a python text box to my article. now i can\u2019t get &lt;br&gt;rid of it! it should not be so difficult to figure out how t&lt;br&gt;o add or subtract something from the article. and where is t&lt;br&gt;he back button??  lousy ui/ui design! a simple editor is a g&lt;br&gt;ood idea. i get that. but so basic that you don\u2019t have a bac&lt;br&gt;k button or a delete function to remove unintentionally adde&lt;br&gt;d features? if you do have them, i am confused as to where t&lt;br&gt;hey are. \n\nfix these things and i will improve my rating.","easy to use to write","best ever","simply superb \ud83d\udca5","love this writing platform and community..it's helped me so &lt;br&gt;much","responsive","explore your talent and evolve through this # medium","good","very cool","very nice and great detail and lots of truth","dev should give a daily limit not a monthly limit. it really&lt;br&gt;

fantastic job of curating articles based on my interests, e&lt;br&gt;nsuring that i always have something engaging to read.\n\nthe &lt;br&gt;quality of the articles on medium is consistently high. many&lt;br&gt; of the writers are experts in their fields, and their knowl&lt;br&gt;edge and insights shine through in their writing. i apprecia&lt;br&gt;te the fact that medium allows both professional journalists&lt;br&gt; and everyday individuals to share their stories and perspec&lt;br&gt;tives, creating a diverse and enriching reading experience.\n&lt;br&gt;\nanother feature that sets medium apart is the ability to hi&lt;br&gt;ghlight and annotate text. this has been incredibly useful f&lt;br&gt;or me as a writer and researcher. i can easily save and refe&lt;br&gt;r back to important passages, making it a valuable tool for &lt;br&gt;learning and reference.\n\nfurthermore, medium's community asp&lt;br&gt;ect is a standout feature. the commenting system allows for &lt;br&gt;meaningful discussions and interactions with other readers a&lt;br&gt;nd writers. i have found the community to be supportive, eng&lt;br&gt;aging, and respectful, fostering a positive environment for &lt;br&gt;sharing ideas and feedback.\n\noverall, i highly recommend med&lt;br&gt;ium for anyone who enjoys reading and writing thought-provok&lt;br&gt;ing articles. it offers a fantastic platform for connecting &lt;br&gt;with a diverse range of ideas and perspectives. whether you'&lt;br&gt;re a professional writer or simply an avid reader, medium is&lt;br&gt;
